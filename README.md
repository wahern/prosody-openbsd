# prosody-openbsd

## Description

`prosody-openbsd` is an OpenBSD sandboxing module for Prosody, using
[pledge(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/pledge.2) and
[unveil(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/unveil.2) to minimize process capabilities
and filesystem visibility.

In the future prosody-openbsd may include additional modules, such as for
native kqueue support, to improve OpenBSD system integration.

## Installation

The Makefile and default compiler flags assume an OpenBSD build host, and
the default installation paths assume an OpenBSD 7.0 Prosody 0.11.13
package.

```shell
  $ make install
```

## Configuration

### Loading mod_unveil

The module `mod_unveil` *should* be loaded as early as possible to ensure
the process is already sandboxed before any module begins loading state.
Unfortunately, Prosody loads modules in mostly random order (by iterating a
hash--not array--built from `modules_enabled` and other built-in lists).
Fortunately, code can be executed directly from the configuration file. In
case future changes are required to ensure an early module loading, this
code can be `Include`d from `prosody.cfg.lua`.

```shell
  $ cp /usr/local/share/examples/prosody/openbsd.cfg.lua /etc/prosody/
  $ echo 'Include "openbsd.cfg.lua"' >> /etc/prosody/prosody.cfg.lua
```

### pledge Option

String of additional pledge promises, or a boolean feature gate flag.
Defaults to `true`. `pledge` is a global option only.

```lua
  -- Example 1
  pledge = "exec unix" -- add exec and unix pledge(2) promises

  -- Example 2
  pledge = false -- disable pledge(2) support
```

### unveil Option

String or table of additional paths to unveil, or a boolean feature gate
flag. Defaults to `true`. If a string, a multiline string of space-separated
permission/path pairs, one pair per line. If a table, a list of
path/permission tuples, each tuple a table with `path` and `permissions`
keys, or indices `1` and `2`, respectively. If undefined, `permissions`
defaults to `"r"`. `unveil` is a global option only.

```lua
  -- Example 1
  unveil = [[
    r    /usr/local/lib
    rwc  /var/cache/prosody
  ]]

  -- Example 2
  unveil = {
    { "/usr/local/lib" },
    { path = "/var/cache/prosody", permissions = "rwc" },
  }

  -- Example 3
  unveil = false -- disable unveil(2) support
```
