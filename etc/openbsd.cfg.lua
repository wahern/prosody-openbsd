-- Ensure mod_unveil is loaded as early as possible, preferably before any
-- other module, but after prosody.cfg.lua has been loaded. One of our
-- primary threat vectors is modules potentially loading untrusted or
-- malformed state and code from /var/prosody, as data under /var/prosody is
-- writable at runtime. We want to minimize our capabilities as much as
-- possible before any module is loaded which may read data from
-- /var/prosody. After all modules are loaded and initializations completed,
-- we can further reduce capabilities and seal the sandbox--accomplished by
-- a server-started hook installed from mod_unveil.
--
-- NOTES:
--   * Modules are loaded in a roughly random order by iteration over a
--     util.set--a hash, not an array--from host-activated handler(s). We
--     must install our handler directly from the configuration, rather than
--     relying on the definition order of modules_enabled. See

--   * Handlers are invoked in descending order of priority. See
